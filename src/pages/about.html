<p>Hello everyone!</p>
<p>My name is Maria J, and I’m an ESL tutor originally from New York, USA.</p>
<p>I received my Bachelor’s Degree in 1986 in Biological Sciences from Fordham University and later that year relocated to live in London UK.</p>
<p>I settled in the UK, although I spent 9 months living, working and travelling in Australia in 1989. In 1990 I obtained a certificate for TEFL from International House in London and then worked teaching English at a language school in Edgware, London for 18 months.</p>
<p>I also taught private students in their homes for 2 years, and later taught UK school children   privately for a year.</p>
<p>From 1998 until 2012 I homeschooled my 2 daughters from the ages of 3 and 4 until they both entered university.</p>
<p>In May 2018 I relocated from the UK to live in Las Vegas, Nevada and I started teaching ESL online in August 2018. Since then I have worked for several companies teaching both children and adults.</p>
<p>I now teach adults only, privately and also via the education platform on Preply.com.</p>
<p>I love meeting so many students from all around the world and having the opportunity to teach from the comfort of my home. To date, I have taught private students from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Russia, Germany, Hungary, France, Austria, Italy, Spain, Mexico, Ecuador, China, Taiwan, Japan, Brazil, Ukraine, Israel, and Peru. I’m looking forward to meeting more students from some new countries!</p>
<p>You can take a look at my Preply profile <a href="https://preply.com/en/tutor/88580/" target="blank" class="new-link">here</a> and my LinkedIn profile page <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maria-james-henderson/" target="blank" class="new-link">here</a>. Below you will find some videos showing you what my speaking voice and accent sound like. The first video is a short introduction message, while the other 2 are pronunciation guides for some tricky sounds in English.</p>
