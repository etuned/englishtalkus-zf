                    <p dir="ltr">Each lesson is 55 minutes long and will only start on the hour, not on the half hour. Based on my assessment of the student(s)‚Äôs level and according to the student‚Äôs learning goals, we will use a variety of resources to target the specific areas you want to see improvement in. I will also give you an approximate length of time that I feel you will need to reach your goals. Every lesson is different and always incorporates all the skills necessary to improve fluency; grammar, vocabulary, listening, speaking, writing, reading and pronunciation. All lessons are conducted on Zoom which is a superior platform for sharing audio files and for optimum video performance. </p>

                    <p dir="ltr">My methodology is an adaptive one, which means that I use a different approach to each student because each of you learns differently and learning a language is never a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù process. What makes me unique and different from a lot of other tutors is that I make every class fun, funny and memorable. I also focus on the student‚Äôs strengths to build your confidence, while having fun learning from your mistakes. My philosophy is that mistakes are the best way to help you learn. Most of all, I like to laugh while we‚Äôre learning. üòä</p>
